/**
 * LifeOS MVP adapter types (LIFEOS-002 — Belief Thread MVP).
 *
 * These are intentionally NARROW, localStorage-friendly shapes for the
 * three-screen prototype. They do NOT replace the full domain model in
 * `types/lifeos.ts` — that broader ontology stays intact for later. Each
 * type notes how it maps to the ontology.
 *
 * A localStorage prototype has no relational tables, so `Revision` and
 * `UserJudgment` (separate first-class objects in the ontology) are
 * flattened into arrays embedded on `Belief`. That is a deliberate MVP
 * simplification, not a change to the ontology.
